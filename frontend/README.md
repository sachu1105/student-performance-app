1. **Cards Component**:
   - Displays student information (name, grades, etc.).
   - Calls the `handleCardClick` function when clicked to display the modal.
2. **Modal Component**:
   - Displays detailed information about the selected student.
   - Includes a close button to dismiss the modal.
3. **State Management**:
   - The `selectedStudent` state tracks which student's data is displayed in the modal.
